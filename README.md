## Omic Learn

Transparent exploration of machine learning approaches for omics datasets.

This Wiki aims to provide general background information for Machine Learning, and it's applicability for clinical proteomics.

On Wiki page, click on the sidebar on the right to get more information about individual processing steps.

## Installation & Running

> More details for [`Installation & Running`](https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn/wiki/HOW-TO:-Installation-&-Running) is available [on Wiki pages](https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn/wiki/HOW-TO:-Installation-&-Running).

- It is strongly recommended to install Omic Learn in its own environment using [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distributions.

  1. Open the console and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name omic_learn python=3.7`
  2. Activate the environment: `conda activate omic_learn` for Linux / Mac Os X / Windows
  
  
  > **Note:** Type following command for conda versions prior to `4.6`:
  >
  > `source activate omic_learn` for macOS and Linux
  >
  > `activate omic_learn` for Windows

  3. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn`
  4. Install the packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  5. To be able to use Xgboost, install via conda: `conda install py-xgboost`

- After successfull instalattion, type the following command to run Omic Learn:

  `streamlit run omic_learn.py --browser.gatherUsageStats False`
  
  > `Running with Docker` option is also available. Please, check it out from [the Wiki pages](https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn/wiki/INSTALLATION-%26-RUNNING/).
  
 - Then, the Omic Learn page will be accessible via [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501).
