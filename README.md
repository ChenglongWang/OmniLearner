## Installation & Running

> More information about `Installation & Running` is available on our **[Wiki pages](https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn/wiki/HOW-TO:-Installation-&-Running)**.

- It is strongly recommended to install OmicLearn in its own environment using [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

  1. Open the console and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name omic_learn python=3.7`
  2. Activate the environment: `conda activate omic_learn` for Linux / Mac Os X / Windows
  
  
  > **Note:** Type the following command for conda versions prior to `4.6`:
  >
  > `source activate omic_learn` for macOS and Linux
  >
  > `activate omic_learn` for Windows

  3. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn`
  4. Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  5. To be able to use Xgboost, install via conda: `conda install py-xgboost`

- After a successful installation, type the following command to run OmicLearn:

  `streamlit run omic_learn.py --browser.gatherUsageStats False`
  
  > `Running with Docker` option is also available. Please, check the installation instructions on **[the Wiki pages](https://github.com/OmicEra/OmicLearn/wiki/INSTALLATION-%26-RUNNING/)**.
  
 - After starting the streamlit server, the OmicLearn page should be automatically opened in your browser (Default link: [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501)
