## 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is taking an important process to get more insight into the dataset before building up a model and it aids to pattern discovery, anomaly detection, checking assumptions via graphical representations.

### [3. 1. Hierarchical clustering](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-bio/clustergram)

Hierarchical clustering enables researchers to group similar objects and the group of similar objects is called `cluster`. Additionally, dendrograms are provided to display the hierarchical relationships between the objects.

### [3. 2. Principal component analysis](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)

Principal component analysis (PCA, in short) is widely used for reducing the dimensionality of the data drastically to make large datasets more interpretable.
